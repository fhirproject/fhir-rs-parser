/// Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes
/// involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource.
/// Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling
/// trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of
/// contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own
/// provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of
/// confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and
/// stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally
/// authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.
